# mwedit
MWEdit is a fan made plugin editor for Morrowind mods. Contact Dave Humphrey (dave@uesp.net) for more information.

It requires the UESP mw-common repository code to compile.

Note that this was written in a very old version of MS Visual C/C++. It has been modified to compile in VS 2015 but
may need more work for more modern VS versions.
